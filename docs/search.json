    "text": "The Hu lab is in the Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M . We explore the ecological significance of unicellular eukaryotes (microeukaryotes or protists) in marine ecosystems. Microorgansims fuel the critical biogeochemical processes that make the planet what it is - in turn, they can be bellweathers of environmental change. We use a range of meta’omics and lab experiments to understand what protists are where and what they are doing.\n\nInterconnected microbial eukaryome\nThe interconnected microbial eukaryome means I am interested in the relationship between microbial eukaryotes and their environment, and microbial eukaryotes and other organisms. Research typically starts with questions such as Who is present?, What are they doing?, and What is their ecological role in marine environments?\nProtistan species make up the majority of the branches on the eukaryotic tree of life. Similar to their vast and complex morphological ( e.g., skeletal structure, modes of mobility, and size), the nutritional strategies (or feeding methods) protists are capable of are diverse and complicated. The three core trophic modes include phototrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy. These trophic strategies place protists at the center of marine food webs – meaning, they mediate or facilitate central routes of energy and nutrient flux. Hence, protists play several key ecological roles at the base of marine food webs."

    "text": "Single-celled microbial eukaryotes or protists are critical team players in most ecosystems on our planet. Protistan communities are composed of hundreds to thousands of species. The species composition of protistan communities can serve as a sentinel of the surrounding environment.\n\n\nFrom coastal environments to deep-sea habitats, protistan community structure (diversity and composition of species) and nutritional strategies are reflections of their environment. While protists form a central theme in my work, my goal is to make sense of how microorganisms fuel and facilitate the processes sustaining our planet. Through the study of microbial eukaryotes, we learn how diverse nutritional strategies of protists are tied to season, time of day, and availability of resources. My main goal is to understand how protistan communities interact with other microorganisms and their environment to support marine ecosystems.\nThree core research themes:\n\nMeta’omics to resolve taxon-specific ecological roles - Leverage temporal & spatial scales to link genotype & phenotype in natural protistan assemblages.\nTrophic interactions at hydrothermal vent food webs - Heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes associated with deep-sea vents play an important role in deep-sea carbon cycling.\nData science - Computational biology is a wonderful opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations. In addition to using data science, I aim to build a “data science community”"

    "text": "Highly reduced and thermally charged venting fluids from the subseafloor mix with surrounding seawater, creating a sharp geochemical gradient which promotes a hub of biological diversity at the site of venting fluid. Studies of the bacterial and archaeal chemosynthetic populations at hydrothermal vent sites have highlighted the important roles these microorganisms play in deep-sea carbon cycling and offered a unique window into subseafloor microbiology. To date, studies of deep-sea food webs and ecological interactions do not typically cover the microbial eukaryotic assemblages.\nHeterotrophic protists are ubiquitous in all aquatic ecosystems and represent an important ecological link by transferring organic carbon from primary producers to higher trophic levels. Previous work has shown protists to be present and active at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and efforts to characterize the composition of these populations has revealed many species to be heterotrophic grazers and parasites. However, efforts to quantify protistan grazing pressure in the deep sea are rare."

    "text": "2 Accessing deep-sea food webs\nTo assess microbial biodiversity, we rely on sequencing the DNA from microbial cells that are collected onto a filter. The genetic material is extracted and sequenced so we can gain a snapshot of the microbial community composition (who is present?). These molecular approaches have been critical in gaining the knowledge we currently have on the microbial communities in deep-sea and difficult to range habitats. Actually getting to deep-sea habitats takes a lot of engineering and planning. Broadly, we can use remotely- or human-operated vehicles (ROVs and HOVs) from a ship. Often we have to run experiments on the ship once the ROV returns with hydrothermal vent fluid or have the ROV collect samples in situ.\nFor this work, I run incubations with diffuse flow fluid collected via ROV to capture the grazing activity of heterotrophic protists. Consumption of microbial prey by protistan grazers (heterotrophs) is a key route of carbon exchange (the transfer of chemosynthetic microorganisms to higher trophic level), and these experiments allow us to obtain a grazing rate (cells consumed ml^-1 day ^day). In order to assess the level of grazing pressure by protists, I compare and contrast the grazing rates and community composisions of protistan assemblages within discharging vent fluid, the plume (hydrothermally-influenced environment above the vent site), and the background deep-sea water.\n\n\n\nProtistan grazing is higher within diffuse vent fluid\n\nIn aquatic habitats, transition zones driven by changes in chemistry or nutrients can create biological ‘hotspots’ of microbial activity.

    "text": "4 Microbes need frenemies\nCan the interaction of microbes with others be defined as friendly? rival? or frenemy?\nEcological interactions among microbes (bacteria and archaea), viruses, and eukaryotic microorganisms are critical junctions in marine food webs. These interactions range from mutually beneficial relationships to sources of microbial mortality. Interactions between viruses-microbes and eukaryotes-microbes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents impact local carbon cycling. This project aims to identify these microbial interactions, specifically those related to cell death by protistan grazing or viral lysis, and explore how they vary across different hydrothermal vent habitats. By providing a better understanding of the composition and nature of these relationships, the investigators aim to build a better food web model of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and improve our understanding of how climate change and other human activities impact the ecosystem.\nOutcomes from this project include the generation of new microbiology, oceanography, and computer science curricula targeted at community college students. In addition, it involves research with undergraduate students at all stages of the research process and provides opportunities for professional development and peer-to-peer mentoring.\n\n\n\nNewly awarded NSF proposal with Rika Anderson & Julie Huber"

The microbiome of the low-temperature (<100C) diffuse vent sites in the region have been frequently studied and the vent field within the caldera include a range of distinct geochemistries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Mid-Cayman Rise - 2020 Expedition\n\n\n\n\n\nI was a part of the RV Atlantis (AT42-22) research cruise to study the geochemistry and microbiology of the Von Damm and Piccard vent fields, located on the Mid-Cayman Rise. We completed 9 dives with ROV Jason at the Von Damm and Piccard vent fields. Hydrothermal vent fluid collection was facilitated by the isobaric gas-tight (IGT) fluid samplers (9) and the hydrothermal organic geochemistry (HOG) sampler (Susan Lang). CTD-rosette casts were also conducted to obtain water column plume and background seawater. Relevant objectives included (1) conducting grazing incubations and (2) collecting samples from the hydrothermal vent, plume, and background seawater environments. Laboratory work for analyzing the grazing experiments and cell counts has been completed and the molecular work is in progress.\nSamples from Von Damm (10 sites) and Piccard (8 sites) vent fields will provide detailed analysis of the microbial composition, biogeography, and role in the food web. 3 of the grazing experiments originated from CTD-rosette casts from the background and plume environment and 6 were conducted with fluid from the HOG. 4 grazing experiments were performed with the IGT, so incubations remained at in situ pressure.\n{fig.cap=“ROV Hercules at newly discovered Apollo vent field.

Low temperature diffuse hydrothermal vent fluid samples <100ºC were collected using the ROV Hercules and a SUspended Particle Rosette Sampler (SUPR; 6). The overarching goal of the cruise was to integrate scientific investigation of the deep sea with the exploration of ocean worlds on other planets, as the deep-sea hydrothermal vent system serves as an analog environment (a part of the SUBSEA program (Systematic Underwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog)).\nFindings from the Gorda Ridge cruise are published: Hu, S.K., Herrera, E.L., Smith, A.R., Pachiadaki, M.G., Edgcomb, V.P., Sylva, S.P., Chan E.W., Seewald, J.S., German, C.R., & Huber, J.A.

SPOT is a part of the Wrigley Institute and University of Southern California, it is a long-term study site that has been visited, sampled, and studied monthly for over 15 years. As a PhD student, one of my main roles was sampling every month - which meant that in addition to contributing to a long-term sampling effort, I got to ask my own research questions that were scientifically and logistically support by this station.\nEach month, we would conduct CTD casts to obtain oceanographic measurements from the water column surface to just above the bottom (~880 meters). Alongside CTD data, we would capture seawater at each site, including the surface, deep chlorophyll maximum, oxycline (~150 m), and hypoxic depth (~880 m). By collecting this seawater monthly, we have been able to capture seasonal and annual trends in the microbial community (i.e., species richness, relative abundances).\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings from the SPOT station\nNaturally-occurring transition zones, such as nutriclines or oxyclines (where oxygen dramatically decreases) attract microorganisms. As a result, there is typically an uptick in microbial species richness, abundance, and activity localized to these sites. Subsequently, microorganisms that consume other microbes (such as protistan heterotrophs) will also be draw to this environment with available prey.\n\n\n\nMicroeukaryotic community diversity and metabolic activity peak at the oxycline\n\nDNA-based observations of microbial eukaryotic populations had revealed that heterotrophic species where present throughout the water column and had a relative increase in the number of species at the oxycline. In a paper from 2016, we used both RNA and DNA tag-sequencing analyses to (1) assess if there was a difference in using RNA and DNA in tag-sequence surveys and to (2) determine if this approach could be used to infer metabolic activity.\nTo access the metabolically-active component of the protistan community at SPOT, we also applied metatranscriptomics. After extracting total RNA from each depth at the SPOT station, we isolated and sequenced the messenger RNA. By matching mRNA sequences to reference transcriptome databases, we can annotate the taxonomic origin and gene identity (functional potential). In the case of the metabolically diverse protists, results from the metatranscriptome analysis brought us closer to simultaneously characterizing the trophic mode and taxonomic identity. At the oxycline, there was a distinct shift in the known heterotrophic taxa, such as ciliates - where a relative increase in transcripts related to fatty acid breakdown was observed. Similarly, taxa known to be mixotrophic (e.g., haptophytes) had distinct transcript profiles in the euphotic and sub-euphotic zones. At the surface, transcripts associated with phototrophy were higher compared to transcripts associated with heterotrophic modes of nutrition at depths without sunlight.\n\n\n\nSurface phytoplankton community varies according to environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 HOT\nThe Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) samples station ALOHA - or A Long-Term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment monthly. This time series has been running for over 30 years. As part of the Simons Foundation funded SCOPE collaboration, I was able to be involved in several cruises to station ALOHA. This was an exciting opportunity to study the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and compare our findings and methods to the coastal ecosystem of California.\nFor one field season, we conducted high-resolution diel sampling by following a parcel of water and sampling every 4 hours. As a result of this work, we captured daily fluctuations in microbial community dynamics, including species compositions, microbe-microbe-interactions, grazing activity, and details of how microbial photosynthetic machinery operates on an hourly time scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies-specific nutritional needs drive temporal niche partitioning among protistan primary producers and consumers."

    "text": "Meetings & participation\nLab meeting: I expect all lab members to attend every lab meeting. Absences are completely fine, as long as they are planned/mentioned ahead of time. During each meeting, I will check-in with everyone to see how their previous week went and what is planned for the upcoming week. This is a great opportunity to check-in with your peers, run ideas by the group, or discuss topics in the field. Themed lab meetings are welcome and may include: journal club paper discussion or discussion of presented hypothesis, demo of technical skill, invited guest speakers, practice talk for an upcoming presentation, or preliminary presentation of new data."

The frequency of these meetings may change as we get to know one another and as each project progresses. A common theme in our early meetings will be on the topic of communication. Clear guidelines and established modes of communications between advisors-mentees is crucial for (1) having a positive research experience and (2) doing our absolute best science together!\nMy role is to offer guidance, support, suggestions, and share my own experiences with you.\nHow is my time split up? include some text here?\n\n\nFrom you (mentee)\n\nUndergraduate student\nGraduate student\nVisiting student or scholar"

    "text": "Collaboration\n\nAuthorship guidelines\nThe lead trainee that typically spends the most amount of time on a specific project will likely be the first author of published work. Individuals that contribute significantly to completing a project, including sample collection, sample processing, data processing, or intellectual support, may be added as co-authors. It will be up to myself and the first author to decide on the author order. If an individual passes a project to another (for any reason), a decision regarding a change in first authorship or co-first authorship will be made at that time.\nCollaborations are encouraged and peer training is an important part of our science. Please consider time management and what a significant contribution is when it comes to evaluating if someone deserves to be a co-author. Additional individuals that assist in the success of a project should be thanked in the acknowledgment section of a paper. Before publication, clear this acknowledgment with each individual.\nIt is expected that projects may take a long time, or someone may move to a new position before completing a project. Please leave a copy of well-documented notes on current project status before physically leaving the lab. Discuss a realistic project timeline with me and be open to potential changes in authorship if a large amount of work is unfinished."
