Protistan communities are composed of hundreds to thousands of species. The species composition of protistan communities can serve as a sentinel of the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nEcological role\nProtistan species make up the majority of the branches on the eukaryotic tree of life. Similar to their vast and complex morphological ( e.g., skeletal structure, modes of mobility, and size), the nutritional strategies (or feeding methods) protists are capable of are diverse and complicated. The three core trophic modes include phototrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy. These trophic strategies place protists at the center of marine food webs – meaning, they mediate or facilitate central routes of energy and nutrient flux. Hence, protists play several key ecological roles at the base of marine food webs.\nResearch initiative\nFrom coastal environments to deep-sea habitats, protistan community structure (diversity and composition of species) and nutritional strategies are reflections of their environment. While protists form a central theme in my work, my goal is to make sense of how microorganisms fuel and facilitate the processes sustaining our planet. Through the study of microbial eukaryotes, we learn how diverse nutritional strategies of protists are tied to season, time of day, and availability of resources. My main goal is to understand how protistan communities interact with other microorganisms and their environment to support marine ecosystems.\n\n\n\nDeep-sea hydrothermal vents\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mid-Cayman Rise. Credit: WHOI\n\n\n\nHighly reduced and thermally charged venting fluids from the subseafloor mix with surrounding seawater, creating a sharp geochemical gradient which promotes a hub of biological diversity at the site of venting fluid. Studies of the bacterial and archaeal chemosynthetic populations at hydrothermal vent sites have highlighted the important roles these microorganisms play in deep-sea carbon cycling and offered a unique window into subseafloor microbiology. To date, studies of deep-sea food webs and ecological interactions do not typically cover the microbial eukaryotic assemblages.\nHeterotrophic protists are ubiquitous in all aquatic ecosystems and represent an important ecological link by transferring organic carbon from primary producers to higher trophic levels. Previous work has shown protists to be present and active at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and efforts to characterize the composition of these populations has revealed many species to be heterotrophic grazers and parasites. However, efforts to quantify protistan grazing pressure in the deep sea are rare.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simplified food web\n\n\n\nSupported by the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations STC, I joined Dr. Julie Huber’s lab at WHOI. Since 2018, I have been involved in several expeditions to hydrothermal vents (see below) to address these main questions:\n\nWhat is the role of protists in deep-sea hydrothermal vent food web ecology?\n\n\nHow does protistan diversity, distribution, and activity influence carbon flux in the deep sea?\n\n\n\n\nAxial Seamount\nWe are currently planning work at Axial Seamount (NE Pacific Ocean) as part of an NSF-funded proposal to characterize the rate and route of carbon via phagotrophic protists.\nUpcoming expedition\nDeferred due to COVID 19\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Jason van on the RV Atlantis\n\n\n\nMid-Cayman Rise\n\n\n\nFigure 4: ROV Jason during the Mid-Cayman Rise cruise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Beebe Woods vent at Mid-Cayman Rise.

Protists are single-celled microbial eukaryotes that play numerous ecological roles at the epicenter of marine food webs as primary producers, consumers, mixotrophs (mixed phototrophic and heterotrophic nutrition), and as partners in various mutualistic or parasitic associations. Within the diverse array of eukaryotic species, protist functional groups that exhibit heterotrophic nutrition or combined phototrophic and heterotrophic nutrition (mixotrophy) have been especially overlooked, especially from in situ studies.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: SPOT cruise\n\n\n\nSPOT\n\n\n\nFigure 10: HOT cruise\n\n\n\nHOT\n\n\n\nData science\nDespite their ecological importance, efforts to catalog protistan physiological abilities and trophic strategies lag behind those of their prokaryotic counterparts.\nReproducible pipelines\nBioinformatic tools\n\n\n\n",
