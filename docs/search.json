Research typically starts\nwith questions such as Who is present?, What are they\ndoing?, and What is their ecological role in marine\nenvironments?\nProtistan species make up the majority of the branches on the\neukaryotic tree of life. Similar to their vast and complex morphological\n( e.g., skeletal structure, modes of mobility, and size), the\nnutritional strategies (or feeding methods) protists are capable of are\ndiverse and complicated. The three core trophic modes include\nphototrophy, heterotrophy, and\nmixotrophy. These trophic strategies place protists at\nthe center of marine food webs – meaning, they mediate or facilitate\ncentral routes of energy and nutrient flux. Hence, protists play several\nkey ecological roles at the base of marine food webs.\nProtists\nSingle-celled microbial eukaryotes or protists are critical\nteam players in most ecosystems on our planet. Protistan communities are\ncomposed of hundreds to thousands of species. The species composition of\nprotistan communities can serve as a sentinel of the surrounding\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nThree core research\ninitiatives\nFrom coastal environments to deep-sea habitats, protistan community\nstructure (diversity and composition of species) and nutritional\nstrategies are reflections of their environment. While protists form a\ncentral theme in my work, my goal is to make sense of how microorganisms\nfuel and facilitate the processes sustaining our planet. Through the\nstudy of microbial eukaryotes, we learn how diverse nutritional\nstrategies of protists are tied to season, time of day, and availability\nof resources. My main goal is to understand how protistan communities\ninteract with other microorganisms and their environment to support\nmarine ecosystems.\nThree core research themes:\nMeta’omics to resolve taxon-specific ecological\nroles - Leverage temporal & spatial scales to link genotype\n& phenotype in natural protistan assemblages.\nTrophic interactions at hydrothermal vent food\nwebs - Heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes associated with\ndeep-sea vents play an important role in deep-sea carbon\ncycling.\nData science - Computational biology is a\nwonderful opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations. In addition\nto using data science, I aim to build a “data science\ncommunity”\n\n\n\nDeep-sea hydrothermal vents\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mid-Cayman Rise.

Studies of the bacterial and archaeal chemosynthetic\npopulations at hydrothermal vent sites have highlighted the important\nroles these microorganisms play in deep-sea carbon cycling and offered a\nunique window into subseafloor microbiology. To date, studies of\ndeep-sea food webs and ecological interactions do not typically cover\nthe microbial eukaryotic assemblages.\nHeterotrophic protists are ubiquitous in all aquatic ecosystems and\nrepresent an important ecological link by transferring organic carbon\nfrom primary producers to higher trophic levels. Previous work has shown\nprotists to be present and active at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and\nefforts to characterize the composition of these populations has\nrevealed many species to be heterotrophic grazers and parasites.\nHowever, efforts to quantify protistan grazing pressure in the deep sea\nare rare.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simplified food web\n\n\n\nSupported by the Center for Dark Energy\nBiosphere Investigations STC, I joined Dr. Julie Huber’s\nlab at WHOI. Since 2018, I have\nbeen involved in several expeditions to hydrothermal vents (see below)\nto address these main questions:\n\nWhat is the role of protists in deep-sea hydrothermal vent food web\necology?\n\n\nHow does protistan diversity, distribution, and activity influence\ncarbon flux in the deep sea?\n\n\n\n\nAccessing deep-sea food webs\nTo assess microbial biodiversity, we rely on sequencing the DNA from\nmicrobial cells that are collected onto a filter. The genetic material\nis extracted and sequenced so we can gain a snapshot of the microbial\ncommunity composition (who is present?). These molecular\napproaches have been critical in gaining the knowledge we currently have\non the microbial communities in deep-sea and difficult to range\nhabitats. Actually getting to deep-sea habitats takes a lot of\nengineering and planning. Broadly, we can use remotely- or\nhuman-operated vehicles (ROVs and HOVs) from a ship. Often we have to\nrun experiments on the ship once the ROV returns with hydrothermal vent\nfluid or have the ROV collect samples in situ.\nFor this work, I run incubations with diffuse flow fluid collected\nvia ROV to capture the grazing activity of heterotrophic protists.\nConsumption of microbial prey by protistan grazers (heterotrophs) is a\nkey route of carbon exchange (the transfer of chemosynthetic\nmicroorganisms to higher trophic level), and these experiments allow us\nto obtain a grazing rate (cells consumed ml^-1 day ^day). In order to\nassess the level of grazing pressure by protists, I compare and contrast\nthe grazing rates and community composisions of protistan assemblages\nwithin discharging vent fluid, the plume (hydrothermally-influenced\nenvironment above the vent site), and the background deep-sea water.\n\n\n\nIn aquatic habitats, transition zones driven by changes in chemistry\nor nutrients can create biological ‘hotspots’ of microbial activity.\nWithin the hydrothermal vent environment\nMicrobes need frenemies\nCan the interaction of microbes with others be defined as friendly?\nrival? or frenemy?\nEcological interactions among microbes (bacteria and archaea),\nviruses, and eukaryotic microorganisms are critical junctions in marine\nfood webs. These interactions range from mutually beneficial\nrelationships to sources of microbial mortality. Interactions between\nviruses-microbes and eukaryotes-microbes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents\nimpact local carbon cycling. This project aims to identify these\nmicrobial interactions, specifically those related to cell death by\nprotistan grazing or viral lysis, and explore how they vary across\ndifferent hydrothermal vent habitats. By providing a better\nunderstanding of the composition and nature of these relationships, the\ninvestigators aim to build a better food web model of deep-sea\nhydrothermal vents and improve our understanding of how climate change\nand other human activities impact the ecosystem.\nOutcomes from this project include the generation of new\nmicrobiology, oceanography, and computer science curricula targeted at\ncommunity college students. In addition, it involves research with\nundergraduate students at all stages of the research process and\nprovides opportunities for professional development and peer-to-peer\nmentoring.\nNewly awarded NSF\nproposal with Rika Anderson & Julie Huber\nStay tuned for opportunities!\nField work\nAxial Seamount\nWe are currently planning work at Axial Seamount (NE Pacific Ocean)\nas part of an NSF-funded\nproposal to characterize the rate and route of carbon via\nphagotrophic protists.\nAxial Seamount is an active submarine volcano on the Juan de Fuca\nRidge in the NE Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Oregon. The microbiome\nof the low-temperature (<100C) diffuse vent sites in the region have\nbeen frequently studied and the vent field within the caldera include a\nrange of distinct geochemistries.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Jason van on the RV Atlantis\n\n\n\nMid-Cayman Rise - 2020\nExpedition\n\n\n\nFigure 4: ROV Jason during the Mid-Cayman Rise cruise\n\n\n\nI was a part of the RV Atlantis (AT42-22) research cruise to study\nthe geochemistry and microbiology of the Von Damm and Piccard vent\nfields, located on the Mid-Cayman Rise. We completed 9 dives with ROV\nJason at the Von Damm and Piccard vent fields. Hydrothermal vent fluid\ncollection was facilitated by the isobaric gas-tight (IGT) fluid\nsamplers (9) and the hydrothermal organic geochemistry (HOG) sampler\n(Susan Lang). CTD-rosette casts were also conducted to obtain water\ncolumn plume and background seawater. Relevant objectives included (1)\nconducting grazing incubations and (2) collecting samples from the\nhydrothermal vent, plume, and background seawater environments.\nLaboratory work for analyzing the grazing experiments and cell counts\nhas been completed and the molecular work is in progress.\nSamples from Von Damm (10 sites) and Piccard (8 sites) vent fields\nwill provide detailed analysis of the microbial composition,\nbiogeography, and role in the food web. 3 of the grazing experiments\noriginated from CTD-rosette casts from the background and plume\nenvironment and 6 were conducted with fluid from the HOG. 4 grazing\nexperiments were performed with the IGT, so incubations remained at\nin situ pressure.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Beebe Woods vent at Mid-Cayman Rise.

Low\ntemperature diffuse hydrothermal vent fluid samples <100ºC were\ncollected using the ROV Hercules and a SUspended Particle Rosette\nSampler (SUPR; 6). The overarching goal of the cruise was to integrate\nscientific investigation of the deep sea with the exploration of ocean\nworlds on other planets, as the deep-sea hydrothermal vent system serves\nas an analog environment (a part of the SUBSEA program (Systematic\nUnderwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog)).\nFindings from the Gorda Ridge cruise are published: Hu, S.K.,\nHerrera, E.L., Smith, A.R., Pachiadaki, M.G., Edgcomb, V.P., Sylva,\nS.P., Chan E.W., Seewald, J.S., German, C.R., & Huber, J.A.

Edwards, each had substrates that\nincluded: shell (CaCO3) Riftia tubeworm shell (chitin), quartz, pyrite,\nbasalt, and olivine). Microcolonizers experienced a range of\ntemperatures, influenced by the diffusely venting fluid nearby\nWhat species colonize these substrates first?\nDoes species richness and evenness vary by substrate\ntype?\nAre the same species found on the substrates also found at the\ndiffuse vent fluid?\nA summary of my findings were presented as part of the ISOP virtual\nposter session.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Graphic comic poster for ISOP, August 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-series\nThe diversity of microbial eukaryotic trophic strategies makes them\nkey players in marine food webs. Protists are single-celled microbial\neukaryotes that play numerous ecological roles at the epicenter of\nmarine food webs as primary producers, consumers, mixotrophs (mixed\nphototrophic and heterotrophic nutrition), and as partners in various\nmutualistic or parasitic associations. Within the diverse array of\neukaryotic species, protist functional groups that exhibit heterotrophic\nnutrition or combined phototrophic and heterotrophic nutrition\n(mixotrophy) have been especially overlooked, especially from in situ\nstudies.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: SPOT cruise\n\n\n\nthe SPOT station\nThe San Pedro Ocean Time-series\n(SPOT) station is located about half way between the Port of Los Angeles\nand Santa Catalina Island. SPOT is a part of the Wrigley\nInstitute and University of Southern California, it is a long-term study\nsite that has been visited, sampled, and studied monthly for over 15\nyears. As a PhD student, one of my main roles was sampling every month -\nwhich meant that in addition to contributing to a long-term sampling\neffort, I got to ask my own research questions that were scientifically\nand logistically support by this station.\nEach month, we would conduct CTD casts to obtain oceanographic\nmeasurements from the water column surface to just above the bottom\n(~880 meters). Alongside CTD data, we would capture seawater at each\nsite, including the surface, deep chlorophyll maximum, oxycline (~150\nm), and hypoxic depth (~880 m). By collecting this seawater monthly, we\nhave been able to capture seasonal and annual trends in the microbial\ncommunity (i.e., species richness, relative abundances).\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Seasonal depth profiles from the SPOT station\nfrom Hu et al. 2016\n\n\n\nFindings from the SPOT station\n\nThe oxycline hosts increased microbial activity.\n\nNaturally-occurring transition zones, such as nutriclines or\noxyclines (where oxygen dramatically decreases) attract microorganisms.\nAs a result, there is typically an uptick in microbial species richness,\nabundance, and activity localized to these sites. Subsequently,\nmicroorganisms that consume other microbes (such as protistan\nheterotrophs) will also be draw to this environment with available\nprey.\nDNA-based observations of microbial eukaryotic populations had\nrevealed that heterotrophic species where present throughout the water\ncolumn and had a relative increase in the number of species at the\noxycline. In a paper from 2016,\nwe used both RNA and DNA tag-sequencing analyses to (1) assess if there\nwas a difference in using RNA and DNA in tag-sequence surveys and to (2)\ndetermine if this approach could be used to infer metabolic\nactivity.\nTo access the metabolically-active component of the protistan\ncommunity at SPOT, we also applied\nmetatranscriptomics. After extracting total RNA from each depth at\nthe SPOT station, we isolated and sequenced the messenger RNA. By\nmatching mRNA sequences to reference transcriptome databases, we can\nannotate the taxonomic origin and gene identity (functional potential).\nIn the case of the metabolically diverse protists, results from the\nmetatranscriptome analysis brought us closer to simultaneously\ncharacterizing the trophic mode and taxonomic identity. At the oxycline,\nthere was a distinct shift in the known heterotrophic taxa, such as\nciliates - where a relative increase in transcripts related to fatty\nacid breakdown was observed. Similarly, taxa known to be mixotrophic\n(e.g., haptophytes) had distinct transcript profiles in the euphotic and\nsub-euphotic zones. At the surface, transcripts associated with\nphototrophy were higher compared to transcripts associated with\nheterotrophic modes of nutrition at depths without sunlight.\n\nSurface phytoplankton community varies according to environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: HOT cruise\n\n\n\nHOT\nThe Hawaii Ocean\nTime-series (HOT) samples station ALOHA - or A Long-Term\nOligotrophic Habitat Assessment monthly. This time series has been\nrunning for over 30 years. As part of the Simons Foundation funded SCOPE\ncollaboration, I was able to be involved in several cruises to station\nALOHA. This was an exciting opportunity to study the oligotrophic North\nPacific Subtropical Gyre and compare our findings and methods to the\ncoastal ecosystem of California.\nFor one field season, we conducted high-resolution diel sampling by\nfollowing a parcel of water and sampling every 4 hours. As a result of\nthis work, we captured daily fluctuations in microbial community\ndynamics, including species compositions, microbe-microbe-interactions,\ngrazing activity, and details of how microbial photosynthetic machinery\noperates on an hourly time scale.\n\nSpecies-specific nutritional needs drive temporal niche partitioning\namong protistan primary producers and consumers.\n\n\n\n\nData science\nDespite their ecological importance, efforts to catalog protistan\nphysiological abilities and trophic strategies lag behind those of their\nprokaryotic counterparts. The interpretation of large sequence datasets\nrelies on the knowledge gleaned from culture-based transcriptome\nstudies, new developments in genetic probing of microorganisms, and\nsingle-cell sequencing. It is imperative that we build reproducible\npipelines and infrastructure to keep up with growing sequence\ninformation.\nMy two data science related goals are to (1) streamline the methods\nto link genotype and phenotype for environmentally-relevant microbial\neukaryotes and (2) create an engaging environment to teach the next\ngeneration of scholars methods in computational approaches.\nContact me if you are interested in building up a ‘data science\ncommunity’.\nReproducible\npipelines & Bioinformatic tools\nEUKHeist &\npreprint\nEUKulele\nTag-sequencing\nwork flows\nExtracting\nmicrobial eukaryotic information from metagenomes\nAnalysing\nmicrobiome time-series\n\n\n\n",
