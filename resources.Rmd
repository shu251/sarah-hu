# Meta'omics

* [Code](https://github.com/shu251/SPOT_metatranscriptome) from [a metatranscriptomic survey of protistan trophic strategies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.14259)
  + [EukZoo](https://zenodo.org/record/1476236#.XRdsuC2ZNTY) database, an aquatic protistan protein database for meta-omics studies

# Amplicon sequence analysis

* I am currently working on streamlined pipelines to determine Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) or Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using **QIIME2** or **DADA2** in R for use in environmental microbial ecology.

# Data management

* [Keeping my R life organized](https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/post/anaconda-r-sarah/) details how I set up R with anaconda on my computer. Introduction to managing projects with conda environments. Includes description of R, RStudio, and IRKernel (jupyter notebooks).
