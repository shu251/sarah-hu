## Sarah Hu, Ph.D.

Dr. Sarah Hu is currently a Postdoctoral Investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M in 2023. Her research centers around the *ecological significance of single-celled microbial eukaryotes* in marine environments. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Southern California, which worked to use time-series data to explore the *temporal and spatial dynamics* of microbial eukaryotic communities (Advisor: Dr. David Caron). Sarah joined Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2018 as a Postdoc Fellow to investigate the ecology of *deep-sea microorganisms found at hydrothermal vents* (Advisor: Dr. Julie Huber). Here at WHOI, she characterizes the key 'boxes' and 'arrows' that make up the microbial *food web* in the deep sea, with a particular interest in protistan grazing on vent microorganisms. Sarah's research questions typically involve oceanic field work, molecular biology, microscopy, and data science.

Sarah is also committed to the next generation of scientists - this includes creating a more inclusive space in the field and lab, and ensuring students have opportunities to learn skills they want and address research questions that spark their interests!
Alongside research, Sarah teaches methods in computational biology, specifically bioinformatics, the R programming language, and data visualization (See BVCN, Software Carpentry, & other R resources.
