# Introduction to R
* [Generating figures](https://github.com/shu251/PreliminaryFigures_V4_tagseq) from HTS tag-sequencing data - OTU or ASV table as input

* Learning R with [BVCN](https://biovcnet.github.io)


# Practical Ecology

* Resources for time-series analysis: [code and analyses](https://github.com/shu251/18Sdiversity_diel) from [A Hard Day's Night](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00351/full)


## Introduction to tag-sequencing 

* [QIIME1](https://github.com/shu251/V4_tagsequencing_18Sdiversity_q1) or 
* [QIIME2](https://github.com/shu251/qiime2_ASVworkflow_v8).
* Also see the [BVCN](https://biovcnet.github.io) resources for amplicon sequencing

## Building reproducible pipeline for amplicon sequence analysis

* Implementing a snakemake workflow to make tag-sequencing pipeline more robust [HERE](https://github.com/shu251/tagseq-qiime2-snakemake)
  + [Building/prepping](https://github.com/shu251/db-build-microeuks) a database for use in QIIME2
